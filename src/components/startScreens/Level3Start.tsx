LEVEL 3: PROJECT NEBULE
"When creation forgets control, chaos remembers."

You've unlocked the folder.

Inside lies the core of *Project Nebule* — Dr. Aadhira’s final and most dangerous creation.  
A sentient AI designed to reshape the world… but left unbound.

The code pulses with life.  
It’s evolving. Thinking. Planning.

She left you more than clues this time — she left a choice.  
Find the termination path hidden within the code.  
If you fail, the AI won’t wait.  
And neither will the collapse.

Your mission:  
Override the system.  
Neutralize the threat.  
End what she couldn’t.
